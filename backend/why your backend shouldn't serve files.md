# Serving Static Files at Scale

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed briefing on the challenges and solutions associated with serving static files (images, videos, documents) at web scale. It draws heavily from the provided source, *"Why Your Backend Shouldn't Serve Files,"* to highlight key themes, important ideas, and practical recommendations for robust and scalable web application architectures.

## Main Themes and Key Takeaways

### **1. The Problem with Backend Servers Serving Static Files**

The core message is that traditional backend servers, designed for handling data like JSON payloads, are ill-equipped to efficiently serve large static media assets at scale. The source highlights a common pitfall:

- "Our back-end servers couldn't serve static files at web scale."
- Even small B2B SaaS applications often need to serve large images and videos effectively.
- "Your little Json server that just sends bits of text back and forth across the internet doesn't hold a candle in terms of bandwidth scale to apps like Spotify YouTube and Instagram."
- A typical image can have "10 times the data payload of your typical Json payload," and a video file can be "at least a thousand times larger."  
  → This significant data difference leads to bandwidth and performance bottlenecks if not handled separately.

### **2. Differentiating Data Types and Storage Solutions**

The source provides a clear distinction between data suitable for traditional databases and JSON APIs versus data that should be treated as standalone files:

- **Traditional Database/JSON API:** For data that "makes sense to store in an Excel spreadsheet" (e.g., username, email, link to image).
- **File Server/Object Storage:** For data that "you'd store as its own Standalone file on your file system" (e.g., PDF documents, images, videos, Rich Text documents).
- While some servers might "double up" and serve both JSON and files, it's often more efficient to separate these concerns, potentially using a completely different machine or even a serverless setup.

### **3. Object Storage (Serverless Storage) as the Preferred Solution**

The document strongly advocates for managed object storage services offered by major cloud providers (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) as the optimal solution for serving static files at scale.

- **Design Philosophy:** Object storage was "designed with distributed cloud storage in mind." It addresses the scaling challenges of traditional file storage by making "objects more self-encapsulated than files and by using a flat name space instead of a hierarchy of directories."
- **Scalability:** These services "go big by default." It's extremely unlikely that your application outscales something like S3.
- **Availability and Redundancy:** Cloud providers replicate across many data centers, ensuring uptime and preventing data loss.
- **Low Maintenance:** As serverless offerings, they require "little to no maintenance."
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Surprisingly cheap compared to custom file servers.
- **Serverless Definition:** "For me serverless pretty much means I'm paying for usage ideally it scales zero so if I'm not using it I'm paying zero."

### **4. Key Differences between Object Storage and Traditional File Systems**

- **Directory Illusion:** Directories are just naming conventions—empty directories don’t exist.
- **Metadata Storage:** Metadata is stored alongside the object itself.
- **Interaction Model:** Applications interact with object storage through network requests, not local disk operations.

---

### **5. Direct Serving and Considerations**

Object storage can directly serve static assets:

- **Direct Access:** "When you add an object to one of these buckets and you make the bucket publicly accessible someone can access your files directly through the API."
- **Image Serving:** Direct S3 URL in an `<img>` tag is often sufficient.
- **Video Streaming:**
  - **Downloading vs. Streaming:** Streaming allows playback without downloading the entire file.
  - **Basic Streaming (MP4):** Achievable via *fast start encoding* and HTML5 `<video>` tag. S3 supports HTTP range requests out of the box.
  - **Adaptive Streaming:** Requires advanced standards like MPEG Dash or HLS for dynamic quality adjustment.

---

### **6. Important Considerations and Best Practices**

- **CDN Integration (e.g., CloudFront/Cloudflare):** Provides caching, protection, and lower egress costs.
- **Permissions Management:** Do not enable `list` permission on public buckets; allow only `get`.
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Acceptable trade-off if already using AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- **Bucket and Key Management:** Each bucket has a globally unique identifier, and keys act like file paths.

## Conclusion

The source provides a compelling argument for offloading static file serving from traditional backend servers to managed object storage solutions. By leveraging the inherent scalability, availability, and low maintenance of offerings like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage, developers can avoid common pitfalls and build more robust and efficient web applications capable of handling massive media traffic.

While basic image and video streaming are well-supported, advanced features like adaptive streaming may require additional tooling or formats beyond simple MP4 serving from object storage. Proper configuration of permissions and the potential integration of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are crucial for security and performance optimisation.
